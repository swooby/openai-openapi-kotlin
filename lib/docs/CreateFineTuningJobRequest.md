## Properties
| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **model** | [**CreateFineTuningJobRequestModel**](CreateFineTuningJobRequestModel.md) |  |  |
| **trainingFile** | **kotlin.String** | The ID of an uploaded file that contains training data.  See [upload file](/docs/api-reference/files/create) for how to upload a file.  Your dataset must be formatted as a JSONL file. Additionally, you must upload your file with the purpose &#x60;fine-tune&#x60;.  The contents of the file should differ depending on if the model uses the [chat](/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/chat-input), [completions](/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/completions-input) format, or if the fine-tuning method uses the [preference](/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/preference-input) format.  See the [fine-tuning guide](/docs/guides/fine-tuning) for more details.  |  |
| **hyperparameters** | [**CreateFineTuningJobRequestHyperparameters**](CreateFineTuningJobRequestHyperparameters.md) |  |  [optional] |
| **suffix** | **kotlin.String** | A string of up to 64 characters that will be added to your fine-tuned model name.  For example, a &#x60;suffix&#x60; of \&quot;custom-model-name\&quot; would produce a model name like &#x60;ft:gpt-4o-mini:openai:custom-model-name:7p4lURel&#x60;.  |  [optional] |
| **validationFile** | **kotlin.String** | The ID of an uploaded file that contains validation data.  If you provide this file, the data is used to generate validation metrics periodically during fine-tuning. These metrics can be viewed in the fine-tuning results file. The same data should not be present in both train and validation files.  Your dataset must be formatted as a JSONL file. You must upload your file with the purpose &#x60;fine-tune&#x60;.  See the [fine-tuning guide](/docs/guides/fine-tuning) for more details.  |  [optional] |
| **integrations** | [**kotlin.collections.List&lt;CreateFineTuningJobRequestIntegrationsInner&gt;**](CreateFineTuningJobRequestIntegrationsInner.md) | A list of integrations to enable for your fine-tuning job. |  [optional] |
| **seed** | **kotlin.Int** | The seed controls the reproducibility of the job. Passing in the same seed and job parameters should produce the same results, but may differ in rare cases. If a seed is not specified, one will be generated for you.  |  [optional] |
| **method** | [**FineTuneMethod**](FineTuneMethod.md) |  |  [optional] |
| **metadata** | **kotlin.collections.Map&lt;kotlin.String, kotlin.String&gt;** | Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.   Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.  |  [optional] |
