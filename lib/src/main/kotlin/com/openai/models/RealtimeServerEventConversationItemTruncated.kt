 * Returned when an earlier assistant audio message item is truncated by the

 * synchronize the server's understanding of the audio with the client's
 * playback. This action will truncate the audio and remove the server-side text
 * transcript to ensure there is no text in the context that hasn't been heard
 * by the user.
 *
 * @param eventId The unique ID of the server event.
 * @param type The event type, must be `conversation.item.truncated`.
 * @param itemId The ID of the assistant message item that was truncated.
 * @param contentIndex The index of the content part that was truncated.
 * @param audioEndMs The duration up to which the audio was truncated, in
 *   milliseconds.
