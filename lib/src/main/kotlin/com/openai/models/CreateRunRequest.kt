/**
 * @param assistantId The ID of the [assistant](/docs/api-reference/assistants)
 *   to use to execute this run.
 * @param model
 * @param reasoningEffort
 * @param instructions Overrides the
 *   [instructions](/docs/api-reference/assistants/createAssistant) of the
 *   assistant. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis.
 * @param additionalInstructions Appends additional instructions at the end of
 *   the instructions for the run. This is useful for modifying the behavior on
 *   a per-run basis without overriding other instructions.
 * @param additionalMessages Adds additional messages to the thread before
 *   creating the run.
 * @param tools Override the tools the assistant can use for this run. This is
 *   useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis.
 * @param metadata Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object.
 *   This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a
 *   structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard. Keys
 *   are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with
 *   a maximum length of 512 characters.
 * @param temperature What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher
 *   values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like
 *   0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.
 * @param topP An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus
 *   sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p
 *   probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10%
 *   probability mass are considered. We generally recommend altering this or
 *   temperature but not both.
 * @param stream If `true`, returns a stream of events that happen during the
 *   Run as server-sent events, terminating when the Run enters a terminal state
 *   with a `data: [DONE]` message.
 * @param maxPromptTokens The maximum number of prompt tokens that may be used
 *   over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the
 *   number of prompt tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run. If the
 *   run exceeds the number of prompt tokens specified, the run will end with
 *   status `incomplete`. See `incomplete_details` for more info.
 * @param maxCompletionTokens The maximum number of completion tokens that may
 *   be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use
 *   only the number of completion tokens specified, across multiple turns of
 *   the run. If the run exceeds the number of completion tokens specified, the
 *   run will end with status `incomplete`. See `incomplete_details` for more
 *   info.
 * @param truncationStrategy
 * @param toolChoice
 * @param parallelToolCalls Whether to enable
 *   [parallel function calling](/docs/guides/function-calling#configuring-parallel-function-calling)
 *   during tool use.
 * @param responseFormat
