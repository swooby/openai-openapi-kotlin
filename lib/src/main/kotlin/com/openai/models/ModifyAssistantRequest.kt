 *
 * @param model 
 * @param reasoningEffort 
 * @param name The name of the assistant. The maximum length is 256 characters. 
 * @param description The description of the assistant. The maximum length is 512 characters. 
 * @param instructions The system instructions that the assistant uses. The maximum length is 256,000 characters. 
 * @param tools A list of tool enabled on the assistant. There can be a maximum of 128 tools per assistant. Tools can be of types `code_interpreter`, `file_search`, or `function`. 
 * @param toolResources 
 * @param metadata Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.   Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters. 
 * @param temperature What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. 
 * @param topP An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.  We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both. 
 * @param responseFormat
